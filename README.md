# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends in the theatre category

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
I conducted analysis through excel, based on Kickstarter data I downloaded in order to help an up-and-coming playwright named Louise. She is looking to start a campaign for her play, Fever. As this is Louise's first experince with Kickstarter and her budget for the play is ~$10,000 she wants to ensure she sets her campaign up for success. I leveraged excel to help her determine the specific factors (i.e funding goal, duration of campaign, date of campaign, etc.) that have made play campaigns successful in the past.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The launch date of Kickstarter campaigns that fell under the 'theatre' category was analyzed in the dataset to determine if this date has any relationship to campaign success. The data included years 2009-2017 and the launch dates were aggregated by month. Campaign outcomes were categorized by 'successful', 'failed', and 'canceled'. The results of this filtering and categorization are summarized in the line graph below.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Another factor that was examined in order to see if there was a relationship to campaign success was funding goal. In the analysis of this factor, we filtered by the 'plays' subcategory. Then, 12 buckets were created for goal amounts in the dataset. Campaign outcomes were again categorized by 'successful', 'failed', and 'canceled'. The results of this filtering and categorization are summarized in the line graph below.
